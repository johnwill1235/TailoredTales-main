# Purpose:

The purpose of TailoredTales is to provide language learners with a free and accessible platform for engaging in extensive reading that is tailored to their individual level and interests. Our platform aims to address the common problem of limited access to high-quality language learning resources, particularly for learners who may not have the financial resources to purchase books or access to libraries with a wide selection of language learning materials.

Our use of state-of-the-art AI technology allows us to provide learners with a personalized reading experience that is both engaging and effective. We believe that extensive reading is a vital component of language learning, and that learners who engage in this practice are more likely to improve their reading comprehension, vocabulary, and grammar skills.

At TailoredTales, we are committed to promoting ethical and inclusive practices in all aspects of our platform. We prioritize user data privacy and believe that access to education should be a right, not a privilege. By providing learners with a free and accessible platform for extensive reading, we hope to contribute to a more equitable and inclusive world where everyone has access to high-quality language learning resources.
